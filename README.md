Comprehensive Lung Cancer Data Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Machine Learning
This project delves into a detailed data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of lung cancer data, employing machine learning techniques to uncover critical insights and patterns. The analysis aims to identify significant features, trends, and correlations within the dataset to enhance understanding and prediction of lung cancer. Through the application of various ML algorithms, visualization techniques, and statistical methods, the project seeks to provide a robust framework for understanding the complexities of lung cancer data and to inform future research and diagnostic approaches.

The dataset has been extracted from kaggle and is uploaded in the repo.
